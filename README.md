# Overview

This website will be a scrolling website no seperate pages unless it's a blog or something.

All main content will be on the main page however.

## TODO - Frontend
1. Navigation styles
2. Hero section styles
3. Implement proper image section
4. Implement Contact page at the bottom
5. Implement footer
6. Space Splash Section properly and remove objectFit as its deprecated 
7 Change font to Times New Roman or Playfair Display

Ask client about color palletes and dark/light styles! This cannot be bland has to be a photography website.

### Navigation styles

Need to decide whether I want a full dropdown menu for desktop or deal with mobile responsive styling. Most of her client will probably be on mobile but still have to consider the alternative.

Will have name of the website as well as navigation to different parts of the website

### Hero Section Styles

TBD - Hero sections are hard

### Image Section

Images will more than likely be displayed via carousel with maybe shadcn or my own homebaked version or some fancy React Bits thing.

### Contact Section

Need to make look better will be simple with only phone number and instagram but still need to make look good.

### Footer Section

Mainly state other info needed and my website for a shoutout

## TODO - Backend

Nothing yet as this will be a purely informational website currently, no scheduling or anything fancy is needed just yet.
